# **Pricing Optimization for PalletTrader**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on pricing optimization for PalletTrader, an online marketplace for buying and selling pallets. The goal of this project is to determine the optimal mix of recycled and new pallets to maximize profit while meeting customer demand, maintaining sustainability targets, and adhering to supply constraints.

The project was implemented using **R** and structured in an **R Markdown (Rmd)** format for clarity and presentation. It includes the use of the `lpSolve` package for linear programming.
